    <p>Chocolate chip cookies just got <em>better!</em></p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Joanne Lee Molinaro started her popular food blog, the Korean Vegan, 6 years ago. She is famous for creating vegan takes on traditional (and non-traditional) Korean food.</p>
        <p>Chocolate chip cookies rank high on almost everyone's list of favorite foods, and for good reason! Adding sweet red bean paste elevates the already great treat to a chewier, lighter nirvana.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 tablespoons (57g) vegan butter</li> 
                <li>¼ cup (50g) light brown sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup (100g) cane sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup (160g) paht</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons plant milk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1¼ cups (315g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 bar (1.7 oz/90g) dark chocolate, chopped into chunks</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle, beat together the vegan butter, brown sugar, cane sugar, red bean paste, plant milk, and vanilla on low speed until the ingredients are combined.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chunks. Slowly incorporate the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients using the stand mixer or a wooden spoon, until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Using a large spoon or ice cream scoop, scoop out balls of dough (roughly the size of golf balls) and place on the prepared baking sheet. Using the back of a spoon, press down on them a little, as they will not “melt” the way normal cookies do.</li>
            <li>Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 11 minutes. The cookies will seem undercooked, but trust me. Cool the cookies on a wire rack for about 2 minutes before diving in.</li>
        </ol>
