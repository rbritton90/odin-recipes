        <h3>Description</h3>
    </p>
    <p>The show <em>Bob's Burgers</em> is a hilarious cartoon following the (mis)adventures of Bob Belcher and his family. Many of the scenes take place inside the show's eponymous Bob's Burgers restaurant, where watchers with a keen eye can spot a unique <strong>Burger of the Day</strong> in every episode.</p>
    <p>These special burgers are a running gag in nearly every episode the show, and the names are always some form of pun and/or wordplay. Some of these burgers sound like they could be reasonably good (like Season 1's <strong>Spaghetti Western & Meatballs</strong>, while some sound downright revolting - I doubt Season 3's <strong>O.T. The Outside Toilet</strong> burger had too many takers!</p>
    <p>Below, we're showcasing a kimchi-forward burger inspired by the show's <strong>The Unbreakable Kimchi Schmidt</strong> burger - with a name riffing on the show <em>The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</em> - that actually tastes great and could hold its own next to many more traditional burger recipes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef patties of your choice</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
        <li>Scallion kimchi - can be found at any local Asian grocer</li>
        <li>American cheese</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Mirin</li>
        <li>Sesame buns</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the beef patties with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder</li>
        <li>Place the beef patties on a nonstick pan at medium-high heat</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes or when lightly browed, flip the patties</li>
        <li>On a separate skillet, cook your bacon slices on high heat for ~2-3 minutes (longer for crispier bacon)</li>
        <li>After 2 minutes, place the slices of American cheese on top of the patties and cover the skillet</li>
        <li>While the patties finish, mix the mayo with a bit of mirin to taste</li>
        <li>Transfer the patties to a plate and lower the heat to low</li>
        <li>Remove the bacon to a plate lined with napkins and lightly dab to remove excess grease</li>
        <li>Place the buns on the skillet used for the patties for 30 seconds to toast</li>
        <li>Once toasted, transfer the buns to the plate and assemble the burgers</li>
        <li>Add the mayo mixture to taste</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
